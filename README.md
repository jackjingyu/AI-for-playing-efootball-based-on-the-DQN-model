# AI-for-playing-efootball-based-on-the-DQN-model
AI for playing efootball based on the DQN model.
First, I would like to thank Lanmo Digital and Yu Shangyexiaoxiao for their open-source contributions on GitHub. They have also published their training videos on Bilibili, which you can check out if you are interested. I am training an AI to play efootball, but my computer's performance is not great, and the model is quite basic, so the training results are poor. You can see the training results here: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gY4y127jB/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=cbecf36a4e43383e3427704d32860061. I started this project in 2023, but I didn't put much effort into it. Recently, I have been looking for an internship, so I thought about open-sourcing it. In fact, the source code is not much different from the previous two experts. Since efootball is a mobile game, you need to use scrcpy to connect your computer and phone. I used scrcpy-1.16. Alternatively, you can install a mobile emulator on your computer to run efootball and then train the AI.

首先要感谢蓝魔digital以及遇上雨也笑笑在github的开源，他们在bilibili上也公布了他们的训练视频，有兴趣的可以去看看。
我训练的是踢efootball的AI，但是我的电脑性能不行，模型也一般，所以训练出来的效果很差，训练效果在这里可以看：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gY4y127jB/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=cbecf36a4e43383e3427704d32860061
这个项目我在2023年就做了，但没花多少精力，最近想找实习了，所以就想着开源。其实源代码和前面两位大佬的没什么不同。
因为efootball是手机游戏，所以需要用scrcpy连接电脑和手机，我用的是scrcpy-1.16。也可以在电脑上安装一个手机模拟器运行efootball然后训练AI。
